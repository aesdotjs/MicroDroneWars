Master Prompt: “MicroDrone Wars” Game Design
Create a game concept for a browser-based, multiplayer 3D action game titled MicroDrone Wars.

The game features:

Two teams of 5 players each

Players control either miniature drones or miniature planes, all scaled like toy aircraft

The environments are realistic real-world settings, scaled up to match the toy-sized vehicles (e.g. backyard, gymnasium, house interior)

Gameplay details:

Game mode is similar to Capture the Flag, with drones primarily defending and planes focusing on attack and quick mobility

Drones are slower but highly agile

Planes are faster and behave like WW1 aircraft from Battlefield 1, using realistic flight mechanics

Both vehicle types are equipped with chainguns and missiles

Controls should feel realistic: thrust, brake, roll, pitch, yaw

The game should be easy to pick up, but offer depth and mastery for skilled players

Each match lasts 15 to 20 minutes

Default camera is third-person, with optional first-person (FPV) toggle

Technical goals:

Built for the browser

Needs to research and select a suitable 3D engine (Three.js, Babylon.js, PlayCanvas, etc.)

Needs to evaluate multiplayer networking stack (WebSockets, Colyseus, WebRTC, etc.)

Prototype-quality: focus is on fun, core mechanics, and playability—not commercial polish
