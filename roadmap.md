I'll update the roadmap to reflect our recent progress and changes:

Development Roadmap

Phase 1: Setup and Prototyping ✅

- ✅ Established project with Babylon.js and Colyseus
- ✅ Basic network connectivity, lobby, and matchmaking
- ✅ Initial Babylon.js scene setup (camera, lighting, basic models)
- ✅ Basic Colyseus room and player synchronization
- ✅ Serve HTML and game assets via a basic HTTP server integrated with Colyseus
- ✅ Implemented AZERTY keyboard support and custom control scheme:
  - Z/S: Forward thrust/brake
  - Q/D: Left/right strafe
  - Space/Ctrl: Up/down
  - Mouse: Aim and roll control
  - Left click: Fire
  - Right click: Zoom (first person view)

Phase 2: Gameplay Core (In Progress)

- ✅ Basic vehicle movement system with physics
- ✅ Input handling system with custom controls
- ⏳ Capture the Flag logic
- ⏳ Basic combat (weapons system)
- ⏳ Vehicle collision detection
- ⏳ Environment boundaries and ground collision

Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)

- Add realistic physics, vehicle damage, and auto-repair mechanics
- Refine multiplayer synchronization and state management
- UI/UX enhancements (HUD, minimap, scoring system)
- Implement zoom functionality for first-person view
- Add vehicle customization options
- Implement team-based gameplay mechanics

Phase 4: Playtesting and Iteration (Planned)

- Internal playtests and user feedback loops
- Gameplay balance adjustments based on player feedback
- Performance optimizations and bug fixing
- Network latency optimization
- Vehicle control sensitivity tuning

Phase 5: Polish and Release (Planned)

- Finalize graphics and visual effects
- Network optimization for lag-free gameplay
- Public prototype/demo release for further feedback
- Documentation and tutorial creation
- Server deployment and scaling considerations

Current Focus Areas:

1. Vehicle Physics and Controls:
   - Implement proper ground collision
   - Fine-tune movement and rotation sensitivity
   - Add vehicle momentum and inertia
   - Implement proper roll mechanics with mouse control

2. Multiplayer Synchronization:
   - Improve vehicle state synchronization
   - Add interpolation for smoother movement
   - Implement proper client-side prediction
   - Handle network latency and packet loss

3. Game Mechanics:
   - Implement flag capture system
   - Add basic weapon system
   - Create team spawn points
   - Add game state management

4. Environment and Boundaries:
   - Implement proper ground collision
   - Add environment boundaries
   - Create basic arena layout
   - Add obstacles and cover
